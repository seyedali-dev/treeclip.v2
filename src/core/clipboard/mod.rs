    ///   (e.g. GNOME/KDE clipboard, CopyQ, wl-clipboard).
    ///
    /// This function follows standard CLI behavior: it sets the clipboard and
    /// exits immediately. On most desktop environments this works out of the box.
    /// On minimal window managers without a clipboard manager, the clipboard
    /// contents may not persist after exit.
    ///

    /// Returns an error if the file cannot be read or if the clipboard cannot be
    /// accessed.
