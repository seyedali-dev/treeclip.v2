# TreeClip 🌳✨

*A delightfully fast CLI tool that bundles your code into a single, AI-friendly format*

<p align="center">
<sub><strong>Author’s Note:</strong>  
This README was drafted with AI assistance. <br/>
I’m usually too lazy to write proper docs, but I actually reviewed this one, so it shouldn’t be too cursed...<br/>
Besides, it writes better than me ( ¬ ࡇ,¬ )<br/>Though the code is written by me! no AI in that!</sub>

## What's This All About? (◕‿◕✿)

Ever tried explaining your entire codebase to an AI assistant, only to spend 20 minutes copy-pasting files? Yeah, me
too. That's why TreeClip exists!

TreeClip traverses your project directory, gathers all your code files, and bundles them into one neat package with
proper headers showing where each piece came from. It's like creating a "highlight reel" of your project that AI models
can actually digest in one go.

**Think of it as:** *Your project, but as a single, well-organized document that preserves all the context.*

## Why I Built This 🛠️

Honestly? I was learning Rust and needed a practical project. But also, I was tired of the tedious workflow of sharing
code with AI assistants:

1. Copy file contents
2. Paste into chat
3. Explain the file structure
4. Repeat 47 times
5. Lose track of which files you've shared
6. Question your life choices

TreeClip turns that into: `treeclip run --clipboard` → done. One command, everything's ready to paste.

Plus, I wanted to practice Rust's error handling, understand the module system, work with the filesystem APIs, and build
something actually useful. Learning by building real tools just hits different, you know?

## Installation 🚀

### From Crates.io (Recommended)

You can install `treeclip` directly from crates.io using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install treeclip
```

This will install the binary on your system, making it available from anywhere!

### From Source

If you'd rather build it yourself from the source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seyallius/treeclip.v2.git
cd treeclip.v2
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be located at `target/release/treeclip`. You can also run `cargo install --path .` to install it locally
from the repository folder.

---

## How to Use It ✨

The most common use case is bundling the current directory and copying it to your clipboard. It's as simple as this:

```bash
# Bundle the current directory and copy it to the clipboard
treeclip run --clipboard
```

Now you can paste the entire project structure into your favorite AI chat! Easy peasy. (づ｡◕‿‿◕｡)づ

### Pro-Tip: Use a `.treeclipignore` File!

For files and directories you *always* want to ignore (like `node_modules` or `target`), create a `.treeclipignore` file
in your project's root directory. It works just like a `.gitignore` file!

Here's a great starting point:

```
# .treeclipignore

# Dependencies
node_modules/
target/
.git/

# Build artifacts & logs
dist/
build/
*.log
*.lock
```

With this file in place, you can just run `treeclip run --clipboard` without needing to add `--exclude` flags every
time. So much easier!

## Output Format

TreeClip creates a clean, AI-friendly format:

```
==> src/main.rs
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}

==> src/lib.rs
pub fn add(left: usize, right: usize) -> usize {
    left + right
}

==> tests/integration_test.rs
#[test]
fn it_works() {
    assert_eq!(2 + 2, 4);
}
```

Each file is clearly separated with its path, making it easy for AI to understand your project structure. No confusion,
no missing context!

## Tips & Tricks 💡

### Shell Glob Pattern Expansion

⚠️ **Important Note on Shell Glob Patterns:**

When using glob patterns (wildcards like `*` or `?`) with TreeClip, be aware that your shell may expand them before
passing them to the program. This can cause unexpected behavior if matching files exist in your current directory.

For example for a directory structure like this:

```text
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── cliff.toml
├── something.toml
├── event
│   ├── main.go
│   ├── main_test.go        # will be ignored (*_test.go)
│   └── some_other_test.go  # will be ignored (*_test.go)
└── src                     # entire folder will be ignored (*.rs)
    ├── main.rs
    ├── lib.rs
    └── utils.rs
```

if you run:

```bash
treeclip run \
  -e event/*_test.go \
  -e *.rs \
  -e *.toml
```

And `.toml` files exist in your current directory (like `Cargo.toml`, `cliff.toml`), your shell will expand `*.toml` to
all matching filenames, resulting in:

```bash
treeclip run \
  -e event/*_test.go \
  -e *.rs \
  -e Cargo.toml cliff.toml something.toml
```

This causes TreeClip to treat the expanded filenames as multiple positional arguments, leading to errors.

**Solutions:**

1. **Escape with quotes:**
   ```bash
   treeclip run \
    -e event/*_test.go \
    -e *.rs \
    -e '*.toml'
   ```

2. **Escape with backslashes:**
   ```bash
   treeclip run \
    -e event/*_test.go \
    -e *.rs \
    -e \*.toml
   ```

This only occurs when the wildcard matches files in the current directory. Patterns that don't match any files in the
current directory (like `event/*_test.go` when no such files exist in the current directory) will not be expanded and
will work as expected.

### Combine with Other Tools

```bash
# Count total lines in your project (treeclip already does that!)
treeclip run --fast-mode && wc -l treeclip_temp.txt

# Compare two versions of your code
treeclip run ./v1 -o v1.txt --fast-mode
treeclip run ./v2 -o v2.txt --fast-mode
diff v1.txt v2.txt
```

### Create Aliases

Add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
# Quick clipboard copy
alias clip='treeclip run --clipboard --fast-mode'

# Review before sharing
alias clipr='treeclip run --clipboard --editor --delete'

# Full verbose snapshot
alias clips='treeclip run --clipboard --stats --verbose'
```

### Project-Specific Configurations

Keep a `.treeclipignore` in your project root:

```
# Dependencies
node_modules
target
vendor

# Build outputs
dist
build
out
*.min.js

# Logs and temp files
*.log
*.tmp
.DS_Store

# Don't share secrets!
.env
secrets.json
```
